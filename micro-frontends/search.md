# Search
## Context and Problem Statement
Implementing a search bar functionality within the application.
## Decision Drivers
* Enhance the user experience by providing a convinient method for searching for products.
* Ensure efficient retrieval of information for the users.
* Enable flexability in search functionability to accomodate different use cases.
## Considered Options
1. Layers
2. Components
3. Workflow
## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the system in layers because the system under
construction does not suggest an organization by data flow or control flow.
### Consequences
* Good: Provides flexibility to design and implement search functionability that retrives products for the users.
* Bad: May need ongoing maintenance to keep the search functionability aligned with evolving application needs.
