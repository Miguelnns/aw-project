# Product List
## Context and Problem Statement
Implementing a product list functionality within the application that showcases highlighted products, offers a category list, and enables filtering by stores.
## Decision Drivers
* Enhance user engagement by highlighting specific products.
* Provide users with an intuitive way to navigate through different product categories.
* Enable users to filter products based on their preferred stores.   
## Considered Options
1. Layers
2. Components
3. Workflow
## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the system in layers because the system under
construction does not suggest an organization by data flow or control flow.
### Consequences
* Good: Provides a seamless and integrated user experience for exploring products, categories, and stores within the application; Enables flexibility to customize the product list component to match specific design and functionality requirements.
* Bad: May diminish the intuitiveness of the application by giving so many options to represent a product list; May necessitate ongoing maintenance to keep the product list component aligned with evolving application needs and updates.
